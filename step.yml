title: Wait for Android emulator
summary: Wait for the emulator to finish boot
description: |-
  If your Workflow contains the [AVD Manager](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/avd-manager) Step,
  use this Step to check if the android emulator is booted or wait for it to finish booting.

  ### Configuring the Step

  Before you start:

  Make sure to add this Step after the [AVD Manager](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/avd-manager) Step.

  To configure the Step:

  1. Add the emulator's serial to the **Emulator serial** input. By default, this is set to the `$BITRISE_EMULATOR_SERIAL` Env Var, which is generated by the [AVD Manager](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/avd-manager) Step.
  1. Specify the number of seconds the Step should wait for the emulator to boot in the **Waiting timeout (secs)** input.
  1. Specify the location of the Android sdk in the **Android sdk path** input.
