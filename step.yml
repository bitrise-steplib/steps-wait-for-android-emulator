title: Wait for Android emulator
summary: Wait for the emulator to finish boot
description: |-
  If your Workflow contains the [AVD Manager](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/avd-manager) Step,
  you can use this Step to check if the Android emulator is booted or wait for it to finish booting.

  **Warning:** This Step is not yet supported on Apple Silicon (M1) machines. If you cannot find a solution to this error, try running this Workflow on an Intel-based machine type.

  ### Configuring the Step

  To configure the Step:

  1. Make sure to add this Step after the [AVD Manager](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/avd-manager) Step.
  1. Add the emulator's serial to the **Emulator serial** input. By default, this is set to the `$BITRISE_EMULATOR_SERIAL` Env Var, which is generated by the [AVD Manager](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/avd-manager) Step.
  1. Specify the number of seconds the Step should wait for the emulator to boot in the **Waiting timeout (secs)** input.
  1. Specify the location of the Android SDK in the **Android SDK path** input.
